Your response goes here!

- I've learned a lot since I took up Web Development and it's been a great experience. I've learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby on Rails so far.

- It's been easy in a way that I've enjoyed whatever I've been doing and I think that has helped a lot because it makes me keep going.

- CSS has been difficult at times because it isn't really a science, it is something that I believe I will keep on improving over time. Another difficult thing would be using APIs that aren't very well documented.

- I am applying as a reviwer so I am not sure about what the first project was but I always learn something new from all the projects I do and they have always helped me in furute projects.
